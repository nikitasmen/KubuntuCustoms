**Die**

**What does this script do?**
This Bash script provides a simple way to shut down, log out, or put your 
system to sleep using command-line arguments.

**How to use this script**

To use this script, simply run it and provide one of the following 
options:

* `-s` (short for "sleep"): Puts your system to sleep.
* `-l` (short for "logout"): Logs you out of your GNOME session.
* (no option): Shuts down your system.

For example:
```
./die -s
```
or
```
./die -l
```
or simply
```
./die
```

**How the script works**

Here's a breakdown of how the script works:

1. The script checks the first command-line argument (`$1`) to see what 
action you want to take.
2. If you choose `-s`, it will put your system to sleep using `systemctl 
suspend`.
3. If you choose `-l`, it will log you out of your GNOME session using 
`gnome-session-quit --logout --no-prompt`.
4. If you don't specify an option, the script will shut down your system 
after a 5-second delay using `sleep` and then `systemctl poweroff`.

**Tips and Tricks**

* Be careful when using this script! It can cause your system to shut down 
or log out without warning.
* You can use the `^C` key combination (Control+C) to cancel the shutdown 
process if you change your mind.
* This script assumes that you have `systemctl`, `gnome-session-quit`, and 
other necessary commands installed on your system.

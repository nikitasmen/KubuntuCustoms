**ScriStaller: A Script Installer**

**What is ScriStaller?**
ScriStaller is a Bash script that allows you to easily install and manage 
your own scripts on your system. With ScriStaller, you can copy your 
scripts to a central location (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/`) and rename them to 
make it easy to use them from the command line.

**How to Use ScriStaller**

To use ScriStaller, simply run the script and provide the following two 
arguments:

* `script`: The path to the script you want to install.
* `commandName`: The name you want to give to the installed script (e.g., 
what you'll type in the command line to run it).

For example:
```
./ScriStaller my_script.sh my_command
```
**How ScriStaller Works**

Here's a breakdown of how ScriStaller works:

1. It checks if the provided script exists and is a file.
2. If the script exists, it checks if it already has a copy in 
`/usr/local/bin/`. If so, it prompts you to replace the existing script 
(in case you want to update it).
3. If the script doesn't exist or needs to be replaced, it copies the 
script to `/usr/local/bin/` and sets execute permissions.
4. Finally, it renames the script to the `commandName` you provided.

**Tips and Tricks**

* Make sure to replace `$1` and `$2` with the actual arguments when 
running ScriStaller (e.g., `./ScriStaller my_script.sh my_command`).
* If you want to uninstall a script, simply run ScriStaller again with the 
same `script` argument but omit the `commandName` (e.g., `./ScriStaller 
my_script.sh`).

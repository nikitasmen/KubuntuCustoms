# Clip

A cross-platform utility script to copy file contents to your clipboard.

## What is Clip?

Clip is a Bash script that allows you to copy the contents of a file to your system's clipboard. You can specify the number of lines to copy, or copy the entire file if you don't provide a line count. The script works across multiple platforms including macOS, Linux with X11, and Linux with Wayland.

## How to Use Clip

To use Clip, simply run the script and provide the following arguments:

* `<file>`: The name of the file you want to copy.
* `-l <number>`: (Optional) The number of lines you want to copy. If omitted, the entire file will be copied.
* `-p <path>`: (Optional) Specify a path to search for the file.

For example:

```bash
./clip my_file.txt -l 5
```

This would copy the first 5 lines of `my_file.txt` to your clipboard.

## Help and Options

If you run Clip with the `-h` or `--help` option, it will display a help message that explains how to use the script:

```bash
Usage: clip <file> [-p path] [-l lines] [-h]
  -p: Specify the path to search for the file
  -l: Number of lines to copy (default is entire file)
  -h: Display this help message
```

## Finding Files

If you don't provide a path with your file name, Clip will search in the current directory. If there are multiple files with the same name, Clip will prompt you to choose one from a numbered list.

## Cross-Platform Support

Clip automatically detects your operating system and uses the appropriate clipboard command:

* macOS: Uses `pbcopy`
* Linux (X11): Uses `xclip`
* Linux (Wayland): Uses `wl-copy`

## Features

* Smart file search - finds files even with partial paths
* Works across multiple operating systems
* Interactive selection when multiple matches are found
* Option to copy specific number of lines

## Installation

You can install Clip using the ScriStaller script:

```bash
./scriptInstaller/ScriStaller ./clip/clip clip
```

This will make `clip` available as a command in your system.

## Known Issues

* If there are multiple files with the same name, you'll need to manually choose one.
* The script uses `xclip` to interact with the clipboard, which may not work on all systems.
